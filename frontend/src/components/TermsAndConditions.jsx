            <p className="text-gray-600">
              A cab booking is confirmed only after TripGlide issues a confirmation number via email or SMS. Bookings are
              subject to vehicle and driver availability. TripGlide reserves the right to cancel or modify bookings in
              case of unforeseen circumstances, such as vehicle breakdowns or driver unavailability, with prior notice
